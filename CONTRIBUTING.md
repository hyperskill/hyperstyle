## Adding a new inspector for an existing language

If you want to add a new inspector for an existing language, you need to:
1. Inherit from the [`BaseInspector`](hyperstyle/src/python/review/inspectors/base_inspector.py#L9) class.
2. Define the [`inspector_type`](hyperstyle/src/python/review/inspectors/base_inspector.py#L29) property. To do this, you need to update the [`InspectorType`](hyperstyle/src/python/review/inspectors/inspector_type.py#L6) class by adding there a name of the inspector.
3. Implement the [`inspect`](hyperstyle/src/python/review/inspectors/base_inspector.py#L33) function, which should run an analysis of the language and return a list of found issues;

Usually the inspector runs a third-party linter through a command line and parses its result. In this case it will be useful to implement several auxiliary functions:
1. `create_command` – creates a command to run the linter via subprocess.
2. `parse` – parses the linter's result and returns the list of found issues. For more details about the implementation of this function, see [this](#implementation-of-the-parse-function) section.
3. `choose_issue_type` – selects an issue type by its origin class. This function usually uses the `ORIGIN_CLASS_TO_ISSUE_TYPE` dictionary, stored next to the inspector, to select the issue type. Also the `ORIGIN_CLASS_PREFIX_TO_ISSUE_TYPE` dictionary can sometimes be useful to determine the type of groups of issues.

Usually the third-party linter needs a configuration file to run. This file should be stored next to the inspector.

An example of inspectors that are implemented in such a way: [`PMDInpsector`](hyperstyle/src/python/review/inspectors/pmd), [`GolangLintInspector`](hyperstyle/src/python/review/inspectors/golang_lint), [`Flake8Inspector`](hyperstyle/src/python/review/inspectors/flake8).

If the inspector does not need the third-party linter (for example, if the inspector works with a code directly), then the above functions are not necessary. In this case, each such inspector is implemented uniquely. Currently, only one inspector of this kind is implemented in Hyperstyle: [`PythonAstInspector`](hyperstyle/src/python/review/inspectors/pyast).

After implementing all the necessary functions, you need to add the inspector instance to the [`LANGUAGE_TO_INSPECTORS`](hyperstyle/src/python/review/reviewers/common.py#L28) dictionary, and update the main [README](README.md) file with a mention of the new inspector there.

If you are implementing the inspector that uses the third-party linter, you must also update the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) with necessary environment variables and commands to install the linter, and update the [README](README.md) file and the [`setup_environment.sh`](setup_environment.sh) script in the same way.
