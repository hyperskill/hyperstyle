class BaseInspector(abc.ABC):
    """
    Each external inspector contains a dictionary in which the IssueType corresponds to the original linter classes.
    The dictionary helps to categorize errors during parsing the linters' output.

    To add a new inspector, you need:
     - to create a class that inherits from the BaseInspector class,
     - define the type of inspector (the type filed) by adding a new option in the InspectorType,
     - implement the <inspect >function.

    Typically, the <inspect> function launches a linter and parses its output (XML or JSON) to get a list of BaseIssue.

    Also, if you need to launch inspectors in memory (without using/creating a file with code, you need to implement
    <inspect_in_memory> function.

    Some inspectors (internal) do not require creating a dictionary with IssueType.
    This is connected to the fact that they do not launch an additional analysis tool and work with the code directly,
    for example, the python AST inspector.
