# hyperstyle

## Description

A tool for running pre-configured linters and evaluating code quality.
It is used for https://hyperskill.org/.

What it does:
* runs pre-configured linters for several programming languages
* parses their output and prints the result using a unified JSON-based format
* evaluates the code quality value (**EXCELLENT**, **GOOD**, **MODERATE**, or **BAD**)

The tool is used on the [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/) platform 
to check the quality of learners' code.
